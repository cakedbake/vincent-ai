- [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/): https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai/ (tested)
- Note: Mistral models are incapable of typing in all-lowercase for some bizzare reason.

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/): https://api.openai.com/v1/ (ewww)

# Temperature
- A temperature of 0°C will make the bot's responses deterministic and repetitive.
- A temperature of 0.5°C will make the bot's responses more balanced between creativity and coherence.
- A temperature of 0.7°C is recommended.
- A temperature of 1°C will make the bot's responses more creative and less coherent.
- A temperature of 1.5°C will make the bot drunk.
- A temperature of 2°C or above will make the bot hallucinate.

# [cakedbake](https://github.com/cakedbake)'s recommended settings:
- Use [DeepInfra](https://deepinfra.com/) as your provider.
- Use `Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct` as your model. [It even beats Llama 3.1 405B](https://artificialanalysis.ai/?models_selected=o1%2Co1-mini%2Cgpt-4o-2024-08-06%2Cgpt-4o-mini%2Cllama-3-1-instruct-405b%2Cllama-3-2-instruct-90b-vision%2Cllama-3-1-instruct-70b%2Cllama-3-1-instruct-8b%2Cgemini-1-5-pro%2Cgemini-1-5-flash%2Cclaude-35-sonnet%2Cclaude-3-5-haiku%2Cmistral-large-2%2Cjamba-1-5-large%2Cqwen2-5-72b-instruct), a model 5.625x bigger, while being 5.114x cheaper.
- Set `MAX_TOKENS` to `8000`.
- Set `TEMPERATURE` to `0.0`.
- Set `VISION_MODEL` to `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct`. Llama 3.2 Vision is garbage in general, but 90B is less garbage than 11B.
- Add `694548530144083978` (an incredibly unpleasant individual) to your `blacklist.json`.

# Vision
- Vision uses your chosen `VISION_MODEL` with a very simple prompt: `Describe this image in 250 words. Transcribe text if any is present.`
- Now you might be wondering, why limit the detail of the image through a description?
1. It allows using a much smarter chat model than the vision model.
2. It allows caching, which saves money.
3. In the case of using Llama 3.2 Vision, it only supports one. singular. image. at a time.
- Should a sufficiently good multimodal model be released, I will rework the bot to support it.

# Blacklisting
- You can blacklist a user, a channel, or a guild by adding its ID to the `blacklist.json` file, like this:
```json
[
	"123456789012345678",
	"123456789012345678",
	...
]
```
- The bot will completely ignore blacklisted entities.
- Note: You need to enable Developer Mode in your Discord client to be able to copy the IDs:
1. Go into User Settings by clicking the cog next to your profile.
2. Go into App Settings > Advanced and enable Developer Mode.
- Refer to section [Environment variables] to learn more.

# Known issue
```
(node:_____) [DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The `punycode` module is deprecated. Please use a userland alternative instead.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
```
Solutions:
1. Use an LTS version of Node.js.
2. Bypass N(ode)V(ersion)M(anager) and run Node.js directly (if you have it installed): `/usr/bin/node index.js`

# Plans
- Add tool usage, Memory
- Custom system prompts
- Speech-to-text
- If I'm really bored, the bot could be made to respond with TTS to voice messages.
- Web searching (with Google)
- DM support may come in the future, disabled by default (you know who you are), but could be enabled manually.
